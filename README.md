# Heart Disease Classifier
This code uses the scikit-learn library in Python to train a decision tree classifier on a dataset of patients' medical information, to predict whether or not they have heart disease.

# Requirements
scikit-learn
pandas

## Usage
Clone or download the repository
Run the following command to execute the code:
Copy code
**python heart_disease_classifier.py**

The output of the code will be the predicted class (0 or 1) for a given set of features.
Dataset

The dataset used in this code is the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of medical information of patients such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., and their respective target classes (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease).

## Model
The decision tree classifier model is trained on the given dataset to predict the target class of a patient based on their medical information. The model is trained using the fit method of the classifier.

## Output
The output of the code is the predicted target class (0 or 1) of a patient with given medical information.
